**Built with:** Electron

Video Converter is an **application** that allows users to _load, play, and convert video_ files into three _different formats_.
Throughout the development process, I gained familiarity with the powerful features of the _Electron_ framework, and I was particularly focused on exploring its potential for creating applications that can be used by _both Windows and macOS_ users.
