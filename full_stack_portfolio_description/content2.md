**Built with:** React

MealTime is a user-friendly **web application** that allows you to track the time when you fed your child, pet, or watered a plant. I created this application because I wanted a quick and easy way to keep regular notes without having to use a pen and paper or type a lot of information into a standard note-taking application. The application is specifically designed to allow you to enter minimal data quickly and conveniently view the information on a daily basis.

To build MealTime, I used React and tested the functionality using _json-server_. Additionally, the application features a _login system_, which allows multiple users to utilize the application.

Overall, MealTime is a simple and effective solution _for tracking the feeding or watering habits_ of your loved ones or plants. Whether you're a busy parent, pet owner, or plant enthusiast, MealTime is an excellent tool to help you stay organized and on top of your daily routine.
