Personal music collection is the very first full-stack application that I have ever developed, and it provided me with excellent practice of CRUD operations. To build this application, I utilized a Chinook SQLite database, which is a great example of a relational music and artist database. The application displays existing artist and track information, and users can easily edit or add new tracks.
Throughout the development process, my primary focus was on testing and ensuring the functional aspect of the application. I learned how to create end-points, effectively send information to the server and back, and make the necessary changes in the displayed data.
Overall, Personal music collection is an impressive achievement and a valuable learning experience. By mastering CRUD operations and working with a real-world relational database, I gained a deeper understanding of full-stack application development. With its easy-to-use interface and practical functionality, this application is an excellent tool for anyone looking to organize and manage their personal music collection.
