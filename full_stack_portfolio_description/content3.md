**Built with:** Html, CSS

Personal **music collection** is the _very first full-stack application_ that I have ever developed, and it provided me with excellent practice of _CRUD operations_. To build this application, I utilized a Chinook _SQLite database_, which is a great example of a relational music and artist database.
The application displays existing artist and track information, and users can easily edit or add new tracks.
Throughout the development process, my primary focus was on testing and ensuring the functional aspect of the application. I learned how to create _end-points_, effectively send information to the server and back, and make the necessary changes in the displayed data.
