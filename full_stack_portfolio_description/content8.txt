<p>In this project I'm exploring AI video generators and workflows.</p>

<p>In November 2025, I tested several of them to see what’s realistic for small teams or startups.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Clear goal:</strong> evaluate capabilities and limitations of video generators by producing content with specific requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> for now, it’s relatively easy to generate fantasy. Precise or consistent results require skill and investment, yet are not guaranteed.</p>

<p>I aimed to generate a <strong>digital twin</strong> to see how well the tools could reproduce likeness, with a few specific requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>keep everything as is from the reference photo</li>
  <li>make one specific change, such as adding a white jacket with black buttons</li>
  <li>make the character speak — I was curious how well the tools would render emotion and lip-sync</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Time</em>: 1 working day</li>
  <li><em>Budget</em>: 2–3 tools, basic plans</li>
  <li><em>Input</em>: images only, no video</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, as you can see, the lady does resemble me...</p>

<p><strong>Midjourney</strong> did a great job preserving everything and adding a jacket. It struggled with the buttons — their number, color, and shape kept ignoring my prompts. I could have paused here to fix it manually in Photoshop, but I left it as is to demonstrate the tool’s limitations.</p>

<p><strong>Veo 3</strong> is one of my favourite choices. I still find the emotions and facial expressions quite exaggerated and unnatural. The best attempt came when “Sunshine” was said twice.</p>

<p><strong>Nano Banana</strong> pleasantly surprised me — a powerful tool, although it refused to “add the jacket,” perhaps focusing on keeping everything as is.</p>

<p><em>A tip:</em> for higher-quality output, upscale your reference images throughout the workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Real scope of the work:</strong></p>

<p><em>Time:</em> ~0.7 working day</p>

<p><em>Cost:</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Midjourney — $30</li>
  <li>Nano Banana — $10</li>
  <li>Veo 3 — $27 (1st month free)</li>
</ol>

<p>This and other experiments with video generators — Synthesia, HeyGen, StudioAi, Sora, Klink, Haulio, Runway — were so immersive that I could easily spend more time playing with the features and techniques, and beyond their business use, they could be a great hobby for anyone!</p>

<p>Things are improving faster than we may assume, so these limitations won’t last — content creators will soon spend less and less time bringing amazing stories to life with modern tools.</p>
