In this project I'm exploring the **Video generators** and workflows.

In November 2025, I tested several of them to see what’s realistic for _small teams_ or _startups_.

---

**Clear goal**: evaluate capabilities and limitations of video generators by producing content with _specific_ requirements.

**Conclusion:** for now, it’s relatively easy to generate fantasy. Precise or consistent results require skill and investment, yet are not guaranteed.

I aimed to generate a **digital twin** to see how well the tools could reproduce likeness, with a few **specific requirements**:

- keep everything **as is** from the reference photo

- make **one** specific **change**, such as adding a white jacket with black buttons

- make the **character speak** — I was curious how well the tools would render emotion and lip-sync

---

**Constraints**:

- _**Time**_: 1 working day

- _**Budget**_: 2–3 tools, basic plans

- _**Input**_: images only, no video

---

Well, as you can see, the lady does resemble me...

**Midjourney** did a great job preserving everything and adding a jacket. It struggled with the buttons — their number, color, and shape kept ignoring my prompts.
I could have paused here to fix it manually in Photoshop, but I left it as is to demonstrate the tool’s limitations.

**Veo 3** is one of my favourite choices. I still find the emotions and facial expressions quite exaggerated and unnatural. The best attempt came when "Sunshine" was said twice.

**Nano Banana** pleasantly surprised me — a powerful tool, although it refused to "add the jacket," perhaps focusing on keeping everything **as is**.

_**A tip**_: for higher-quality output, **upscale** your reference images **throughout the workflow**.

**Real scope of the work:**

_**Time:**_ ~0.7 working day

_**Cost:**_

- Midjourney — $30

- Nano Banana — $10

- Veo 3 — $27 (1st month free)

This and other experiments with video generators — Synthesia, HeyGen, StudioAi, Sora, Klink, Haulio, Runway — were so immersive that I could easily spend more time playing with the features and techniques — and, by the way, beyond their business use, they could be a great hobby for anyone!

Things are improving faster than we may assume, so these limitations won’t last — content creators will soon spend less and less time bringing amazing stories to life with modern tools.
