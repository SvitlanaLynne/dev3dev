**Built with:** React

"Flowers" is a simple yet functional **online shop**. Browse through product _listings, apply filters_, and enjoy the convenience of _sorting_ features. It includes key functionality such as _fetching product data, routing, and more_.
Design was not developed for this project, it showcases the functionality only, so basic css and sample images were implemented. One of the key features of this project is the simulation of a database with _json-server_ and _bulk import_ data from a file.
